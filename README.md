# EarchivePdfFileExtractor
This application allows the user to extract e-invoice from the selected "name.zip.json" file by converting it into an PDF file.

If you download an e-invoice from the E-Arşiv Portal (Türkiye Tax Office e-invoicing website) on your Android device, a file named "name.zip.json" will be downloaded instead of a file named "name.zip".
The "name.zip" file contains an HTML and an XML file. The HTML file shows the e-invoice content.
